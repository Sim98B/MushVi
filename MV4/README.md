# Mushroom Vision 4 üçÑ

This first project has the ambitious goal of building a deep learning model capable of classifying images of fungi into their species, providing information on the edibility or toxicity of each recognized species

The [Mushroom Vision 4 app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/simo98/MushroomVision4), currently running on HuggingFace, uses a DenseNet161 architecture to classify mushroom images into 4 classes.

The table below shows the species considered in this study.
