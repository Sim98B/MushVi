# Mushroom Vision üçÑ
## **The computer vision for safe and informed knowledge about the gold of the mountains**

This project was born from the combination of passion, technical skills and the need to have a tool that could help those who, like me, happened to be passionate about mushroom picking in the fall season.

The first project is [Mushroom Vision 4](MV4/README.md) which classifies 4 species, 2 poisonous and 2 potentially edible respectively 2 amanites, [muscaria](Species/02_AmanitaMuscaria.jpg) and [vaginata](Species/03_AmanitaVaginata.jpg), and 2 boletus, [edulis](Species/07_BoletusEdulis.jpg) and [erythropus](Species/08_BoletusErythropus.jpg) with excellent results.

The next version will be able to work with 10 different species, Mushroom Vision 10.

An [object detection model](MushD4/) was built before Mushroom Vision 10 was implemented to overcome the problem of classifying photos that do not actually contain mushrooms into a particular species.
